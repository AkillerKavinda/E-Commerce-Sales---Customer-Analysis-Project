# E-Commerce Sales & Customer Analysis Project

> **Note:** This project was built while following a YouTube tutorial to practice and learn MySQL. The goal was to understand the concepts and apply them. Any modifications or experiments I made are my own.

## Project Overview
Analyzing sales and customer behavior on an e-commerce platform using MySQL by answering 18 business questions. I explore product performance, revenue trends, customer purchasing patterns, payment methods, and feedback ratings to gain insights.
